# Super Tutors

![responsive design](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107180641/228759901-cb04e3bf-c9e4-4869-a1e0-2d4d68071e3c.png)


This project "Super Tutors" was to build a platform for teenagers or their parents to book sessions for science tuition. This allows the user to book tuition sessions that take place at a tuition centre in Wembley. They can book their sessions by choosing the tuition type, date and time. They can only book sessions that are available within the next two weeks and are unable to edit their appointments last minute (within 2 days of the appointment). The user can book, read, edit, and cancel their booked sessions. The admin user can see all of the tuition sessions that have been booked by the different users and is also able to edit and delete them.

## Deployment
1. On the Heroku dashboard select "create new app", app called "booking-tutor-sessions"
2. Add Buildpack: heroku/python
3. Add Config Vars:[PORT:8000], [SECRET_KEY:*******], [HEROKU_POSTGRESQL_CHARCOAL_URL:postgress://....], [DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC:1], [DATABASE_URL:postgress://....], [CLOUDINARY_URL:cloudinary://...]   
4. Linked the Heruko app to the GitHub repository "Super-Tutors"
5. Clicked on "Manually Deploy"

live link to website: https://booking-tutor-sessions.herokuapp.com/


## Cloning
1. On GitHub on the main page of this repository, on the top right click "Code"
2. Click "local" tab
3. Copy the URL link
4. Where you want to clone the file, use command "git clone" and pass through the URL
5. Complete code should now be available on your local system for you to edit


## Known Errors
- Issues about deployment. knowingly deployed with config vars "DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC = 1" as CSS and javascript were not loading otherwise.
- Python validator 
  - Errors due to code line > 79, code put through formatter and some lines could not be shortened.
  - Error in views.py file, "!=" used instead of "is not" as a comparison as this raised a syntax error.
- HTML errors, mainly due to formatting of static files {% static css/stylesheet.css %}, but this is how you connect the files so nothing can be done.
- User issue, Even though you cannot edit your appointment within two days of the appointment, you can delete the appointment.
- Admin pages not connected to CSS files.
